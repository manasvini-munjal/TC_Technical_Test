# Description
A fluid HTML5 page containing a simple login form for user's username and password as follows:
  - username: admin
  - password: password
  
Upon entering the correct credentials, a webpage with with 4 "modes" of responsiveness are displayed
  1. Desktop (from 3/4 width of the screen to 100%) 
  2. Tablet (between half and 3/4 of the screen) 
  3. Portrait (show between 1/4 and 2/4 of the screen) 
  4. Mobile (show when re-sizing browser to under 1/4 of the screen) 

  - Additionally, the content shifts down based on the screen modes mentioned above (page is fully responsive) and the mobile mode hides the menu.

-This project was built using only HTML5, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
-The project uses BEMIT (BEM + ITCSS) naming methodology to define the  classes. It gives a clearer purpose to how classes are related to each other along with making the styles and structure orderly and maintainable. It is a wonderful approach to writing CSS selectors. 
- Although simple and with only 2 elements, the project's CSS file maintains a 'Table Of Contents' for ease of use and best practices!
- This project follows Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1
